# Predictive-Analysis-of-Online-Learning-Outcomes
A machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of success for online seminars and lectures
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of success for online seminars and lectures. The model will be trained on a dataset containing information about a variety of online events, including the content, the participants, and any other relevant factors.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
In order to run this project, you will need to have the following software installed on your machine:

* Python 3.6 or higher
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* You will also need to have a dataset containing information about online seminars and lectures.

## Installing
* Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
* Navigate to the root directory of the project.
* Install the required packages by running the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running the model
* To train and evaluate the machine learning model, run the following command from the root directory of the project: `python main.py`
* This will train the model on the training data, and evaluate its performance on the testing data. The evaluation metrics will be printed to the console.
