First, you'll need to download and install GitKraken on your computer.

Once you have GitKraken installed, create a new repository by clicking on the "+" button in the left-side menu, and then select "Create Repository."

Give your repository a name, such as "Predictive-Analysis-of-Online-Learning-Outcomes," and select a location to store the repository on your local machine.

Next, you'll need to create the files for your Predictive Analysis project. You can create these files using a text editor or a programming language of your choice.

Once you have created your files, add them to your GitKraken repository. To do this, click on the "Files" tab and then click the "+" button to add your files.

After adding the files, it's time to commit your changes. To do this, click on the "Commit" button in the top right corner of the GitKraken interface.

In the "Commit Changes" dialog box, enter a descriptive message for your commit and then click "Commit."

To see the history of your commits, click on the "History" tab in the GitKraken interface. This will give you a visual representation of all of your commits, and you can use it to track the changes you've made to your project over time.

If you need to make changes to your code, you can do so by opening the relevant file, making the changes, and then committing the changes as described in steps 5-7.

When you're ready to share your code with others, you can push your changes to a remote repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. To do this, click on the "Push" button in the top right corner of the GitKraken interface.
